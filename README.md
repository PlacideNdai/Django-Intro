# Django-Intro
I have never worked with Django before, and I had an opportunity to learn as I was working on a project. To make things easy to learn, I created this repo so that I can isolate the DB from the project elements. This simplified everything to the basics, which is the perfect place to start. 

# Hidden variables
I have learned that it's not good to have passwords and other details to the DB in the code itself. So, you will notice that I used config(), which accesses the '.env' file, and it's never uploaded here.
